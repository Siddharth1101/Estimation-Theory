# Estimation-Theory
When portfolios are described by their mean and variance, the  assumption of normal distribution is natural. However most financial  and real world variables have fatter tails than normal, implying extreme events are more likely to occur. 
* Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are two risk measures focusing on adverse events. 
* CVaR is a widely used risk metric in applications such as finance. We derive concentration bounds for CVaR estimates, considering separately the cases of sub-Gaussian, light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions.
